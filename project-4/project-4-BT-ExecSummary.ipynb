    "#### Components of Job Posing that disguish data scientists from other data jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "The required skillset of the job posting was used to analyse if the skillset of the data scientist is different from other data jobs. i.e. if we can predict that the job is a data scientist based on the skillset, then the skillset distinguishes data scientist from other data jobs.

    "To avoid imbalanced dataset, 500 samples of manager in healthcare industry and 500 samples of manager in government jobs were used. This provides a baseline score of 0.5.\n",
