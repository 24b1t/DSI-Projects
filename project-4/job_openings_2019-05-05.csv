The Construction industry undertakes the world’s largest, most expensive, and complex projects ever dreamt of by mankind. Yet, the Construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies and as a result, there exists a large amount of inefficiencies and problems that Hubble can create positive value and make a great impact on. This impacts the homes people live in, offices people work in, and cities generations live in. There is no other industry where technology can have a greater impact. Bar none. Hubble’s vision is to build the pillars of trust for the Construction industry and we are on a mission to develop the autonomous self-building construction sites of tomorrow - powered by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.. Our first step to our mission is to track the Man, Machine, Material, and Money (4M) data - for the Construction industry. The 4M data can be used to optimise operations at the worksites as well as to build an automated trading platform for the 4M. We have grown rapidly to become the market leader in each of the 4M verticals: 1. Man: We have more than 10,000 construction workers (~5% market share) on Hubble's platform and have tracked more than 35 million man-hours in total. 2. Machine: We track more than 1.5 million machinery transactions/year and have >US$100 million worth of machinery on Hubble's platform today. 3. Material: We developed Hubble Maps (Patent Pending) for precise indoor material and man tracking. We were awarded BCA's Innovation Grant 2018 and presented our technology to DPM Teo Chee Hean. 4. Money: We are deployed at iconic projects such as Project Jewel, Paya Lebar Quarters, Gardens by the Bay, and City Gate and have tracked more than $1 billion in project value. Interesting fact: We have grown rapidly without any venture funding to become the market leader in this space in less than 1 year. Our partners include the largest and most prestigious Construction companies such as Woh Hup, Lum Chang, Hexacon, Erect Group, Koh Kock Leong Enterprise, Chuan Lim Construction, and OAS Painting and Construction. We have also built the best engineering, product, and business team comprising the best and brightest of Singapore. We are a collegial set up and are extremely collaborative. We are hiring aggressively and are looking for motivated, smart, driven, and resourceful people to join our team. Hubble has entered into a 12 - 18 months partnership with 2 leading Data Companies who are experts in big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence - BoostML (see attached BoostML_Intro.pdf) and A*Star (see here) to help build up Hubble’s data infrastructure and strategy. BoostML will station 3 senior data scientists and engineers at Hubble full time over 18 months. We are looking for a talented Junior Data Scientist/Engineer who is passionate about this space and looking to learn the tools of the trade from the best in the business. You will be learning from BoostML and A*Star to build up Hubble’s data capabilities and take full ownership and leadership of this vertical at the end of 18 months after BoostML and A*Star completes the build up phase. This is an exciting and challenging role and our bet is on you. We want to groom and train you to become the future leaders in Hubble (see What Hubble will give you section). You want to be a data scientist but lack the ‘right’ paper qualifications for the job. You feel that you have talents in abundance but they are not recognised because of ‘paper qualifications’. You want to make an impact at work and make a dent in the universe. You want to be in a dynamic, fun, and energetic environment. You also want to be mentored by the best data scientists and engineers in Asia and aspire to take on leadership role in a fast growing startup. You want to step up to the plate now. You want to bat for home run and help build up the data capability of a fast growing company - Hubble. Hubble is built by a team of talented, driven, and ambitious individuals. We do not subscribe to conventions. We do not let history and traditions dictate and limit our dreams to shape the world. We adopt the same mindset with our hiring. We are looking for the best and we want to bet on you. In this position, we will give you all the exposure and resources you need to eventually grow into the role of Head of Data.

Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualisation solutions. For more information about I²R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg﻿ We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data. Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Training 1B neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Towards better modelling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions. Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.

However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Towards better modelling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions. Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.

Incorporated in  November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-  years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors  such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore  Government), the company’s accolades include:   We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the  government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations  due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-  grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)   We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the  regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our  approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly  auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-  Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-  innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)   We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services  space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)   We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017  where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite  – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-  accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)  In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our  products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite  (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40%  operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs.  Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our  proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the  process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach).  Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the  option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points),  make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.  Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic,  increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static  rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss.

The Construction industry undertakes the world’s largest, most expensive, and complex projects ever dreamt of by mankind. Yet, the Construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technologies and as a result, there exists a large amount of inefficiencies and problems that Hubble can create positive value and make a great impact on. This impacts the homes people live in, offices people work in, and cities generations live in. There is no other industry where technology can have a greater impact. Bar none. Hubble’s vision is to build the pillars of trust for the Construction industry and we are on a mission to develop the autonomous self-building construction sites of tomorrow - powered by big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.. Our first step to our mission is to track the Man, Machine, Material, and Money (4M) data - for the Construction industry. The 4M data can be used to optimise operations at the worksites as well as to build an automated trading platform for the 4M. We have grown rapidly to become the market leader in each of the 4M verticals: 1. Man: We have more than 10,000 construction workers (~5% market share) on Hubble's platform and have tracked more than 35 million man-hours in total. 2. Machine: We track more than 1.5 million machinery transactions/year and have >US$100 million worth of machinery on Hubble's platform today. 3. Material: We developed Hubble Maps (Patent Pending) for precise indoor material and man tracking. We were awarded BCA's Innovation Grant 2018 and presented our technology to DPM Teo Chee Hean. 4. Money: We are deployed at iconic projects such as Project Jewel, Paya Lebar Quarters, Gardens by the Bay, and City Gate and have tracked more than $1 billion in project value. Interesting fact: We have grown rapidly without any venture funding to become the market leader in this space in less than 1 year. Our partners include the largest and most prestigious Construction companies such as Woh Hup, Lum Chang, Hexacon, Erect Group, Koh Kock Leong Enterprise, Chuan Lim Construction, and OAS Painting and Construction.

Established in 1981, the   is one of the founding Schools of the Nanyang Technological University. Built on a culture of excellence, the School is renowned for its high academic standards and strong tradition in research. To support teaching and cutting-edge research, EEE is host to 11 research centres and more than 50 laboratories, which are well-equipped with modern facilities and state-of-the-art equipment. With about 200 faculty members and an enrolment of more than 4,000, of which about 1,300 are graduate students, it is one of the largest EEE schools in the world. To treat neurological patients, an in-depth analysis and understanding of patient-specific EEG is required and critical. However, visual inspection of EEG recordings is prohibitively time-consuming, and most hospitals do not have the personnel for this task. Automated algorithms to inspect EEG will allow us to analyse much larger volumes of EEG signals, in turn allowing us to build up a detailed database of waveforms associated with epilepsy and other neurological disorders. It has potential application in real-time seizure detection, non-expert EEG evaluation, and improved understanding of neurological disorders. We will develop deep learning methods for analysing EEG signals, which is an entirely new approach with much potential. Deep learning methods have consistently outperformed standard methods for speech and image analysis, and are expected to outshine existing methodologies also for biomedical signals and EEG in particular. In this project, we have the following aims: Aim1: To apply existing deep learning algorithms (CNN and LSTM recurrent networks) for the specific application of recognizing patterns in time series, and identify strengths and weaknesses of the existing algorithms. Aim2: To develop novel deep learning algorithms based on Bayesian variational inference and other approaches, for the specific application of recognizing patterns in time series. Aim3: To apply these deep learning algorithms for reliable EEG-based BCI classification and automatic detection of epileptic seizures from pediatric EEG (Physionet dataset).

SimMobility is an agent-based simulator that links together various mobility-sensitive behavioral models with state-of-the-art simulators to predict impacts of mobility demands, infrastructure changes, and evolving transportation options on the deployment and delivery of people, firms, services and freight. This particular Postdoctoral Associate will focus on the so-called ‘long-term’ module of SimMobility. The behavioral models in the long-term, agent-based simulator address household residential choice, vehicle availability, firm location and real-estate markets in a manner that is tightly integrated with an activity-based ‘mid-term’ model that estimates agent-specific ‘logsum’ accessibility measures for simulated daily activity patterns. The overall scope of FM research includes a number of projects on the development, and analysis of new and advanced forms of mobility options (such as on-demand mobility and autonomous vehicles), as well as on their urban planning and management implications. Both FM, and the SMART Centre, encourage exploration of new ideas and the use of ‘big data’ to advance our understanding of behavioral choices, urban activity patterns and the adoption of new forms of mobility. Depending upon project assignment and postdoc skills and interests, the specific responsibilities will involve some combination of the following:","Advanced skill and experience in data processing and analysis is required. Expertise in agent-based modeling, urban-scale transport modeling; and/or behavioral economics and real-estate markets is desired. Knowledge of urban economics, discrete choice models, geoprocessing, and database management is expected. Experience with programming in scientific languages (e.g. Python and R) is necessary.
